# 🟦 Day 07 — Kubernetes YAML & Pod Management
### 40 Days Kubernetes Series — K8s-Playground

This session focused on mastering YAML in Kubernetes, converting imperative commands into declarative configurations, and practically working with Pods using both approaches. You also troubleshooted real-world container image issues using Kubernetes-native debugging commands.

# 📘 What is YAML?

YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a lightweight, human-readable configuration language widely used across DevOps, cloud-native workflows, automation, and especially Kubernetes.

It provides a clean, structured way to express configuration in a declarative format, allowing Kubernetes to maintain the system’s desired state automatically.

### Key Characteristics of YAML
- Simple and human-friendly syntax  
- Uses indentation-based structure (2 spaces, no tabs)  
- Supports lists and nested hierarchies  
- Highly readable compared to JSON and XML  
- Universally used for Kubernetes resource definitions

# 🧩 Why YAML is Essential in Kubernetes

Kubernetes operates on the principle of a desired state, meaning you describe what you want, and Kubernetes ensures it becomes reality. YAML is the language used to express that desired state.

### YAML enables:
- Version-controlled infrastructure (GitOps)  
- Consistent deployments across environments  
- Repeatable and automated workflows  
- Declarative configuration for Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.  
- Easy collaboration and sharing of manifests

# 🧱 Basic YAML Structure for Kubernetes

Below is a typical Pod definition in YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  labels:
    app: demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
Important YAML Rules in Kubernetes
Indentation = 2 spaces

No tabs allowed

Lists begin with "-"

Keys must be aligned correctly

Order of main sections matters (apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec)

🏗️ TASK 1 — Create a Pod Using Imperative Commands
First, we used the kubectl run command to create a Pod quickly using an image.

Command
bash
Copy code
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
Verify
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod nginx
🏗️ TASK 2 — Generate YAML From an Imperative Pod & Recreate
Step 1 — Export YAML from Running Pod
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pod nginx -o yaml > nginx.yaml
Step 2 — Edit and Clean the YAML
Remove automatically generated fields:

status

uid

resourceVersion

creationTimestamp

managedFields

selfLink

Update the Pod name:

yaml
Copy code
metadata:
  name: nginx-new
Step 3 — Apply the New YAML
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
Step 4 — Verify Creation
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Expected output includes:

cpp
Copy code
nginx
nginx-new
🧪 TASK 3 — Apply Faulty YAML, Identify Issues, and Fix Them
Provided YAML (with errors)
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: test
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: rediss
    name: redis
The issue: image name "rediss" is incorrect → the Pod will fail with ImagePullBackOff.

Step-by-Step Troubleshooting
Apply the YAML
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f redis.yaml
Check Pod status
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
You will see:

nginx
Copy code
ErrImagePull
Describe the Pod for exact error
bash
Copy code
kubectl describe pod redis
Expected message:

arduino
Copy code
Failed to pull image "rediss": image not found
Back-off pulling image "rediss"
This confirms the incorrect image name.

Fix the YAML File
Correct the image name:

yaml
Copy code
image: redis
Reapply:
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f redis.yaml
Final Verification:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Expected:

sql
Copy code
redis   Running
🟦 Key Takeaways
YAML is the backbone of Kubernetes configuration

Declarative manifests make deployments scalable and automated

Converting imperative resources into YAML is a key DevOps skill

kubectl describe is essential for troubleshooting

ImagePullBackOff errors often relate to incorrect image names

Clean YAML files before recreating Pods from exported manifests

🏁 Conclusion
Today’s session provided deep hands-on experience with Kubernetes YAML, a foundational skill for anyone working with Kubernetes, DevOps, Cloud Engineering, or GitOps. You learned how to:

Create Pods imperatively

Convert running Pods into reusable YAML manifests

Rebuild Pods declaratively

Debug and fix real-world Kubernetes errors

These concepts prepare you for upcoming topics like Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services, Namespaces, and ConfigMaps.
